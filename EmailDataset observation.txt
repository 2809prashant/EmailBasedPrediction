Extract data 52 emails 

'subject', 'body', 'opened', 'meeting link clicked', 'responded'


Task Description:

1. Data Analysis:

- Given a dataset on email engagement (including open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates), perform an exploratory data analysis.
- Identify potential key patterns and insights, using statistical and visualization techniques.

2. Model Development:

- Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of email engagement (open rates or link clicks) based on the features available in the dataset.
- Document the model development process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and validation in a Jupyter notebook.

3. Insights and Reporting:

- Analyze the modelâ€™s performance and interpret its predictions
- Draft a report summarizing the analysis approach, model development process, key findings, and actionable insights for improving email engagement.

4. Collaboration Simulation:

- Submit the Jupyter notebook and report as a pull request in a simulated version control environment. The pull request description should clearly articulate the changes and their rationale.

Deliverables:

* A Jupyter notebook with detailed analysis and model development code.
* A concise report summarizing methodology, findings, and recommendations.

Time Frame: 2.5 hours.

Evaluation Criteria:

* Proficiency in analyzing datasets and deriving meaningful insights.
* Technical ability in developing and evaluating machine learning models.
* Effectiveness in communicating technical information and business insights.
* Familiarity with version control systems and collaborative project workflows.
